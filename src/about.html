    <p>My current day job is working for Microsoft in the Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) where I have really been
      getting into the depths of the open source world in ways I never knew were possible. I've always been fascinated
      with open source and the intersection between community and engineering, so when I saw an opportunity to join this
      fantastic team I jumped on it. We run the open source program at Microsoft with an engineering mindset, pushing
      for culture change, breaking down barriers, and building a lot of really cool stuff.

    <p>I'm almost alway making something. I have yet to find a project that loses my interest</p>
    <p>One thing led to another and this or that happened and then I ended up in this situation or that situation and
      all of a sudden here I am and there I was. I just knew it and I knew it well. From that point on I was hooked. I
      am a developer and a developer I am. This is my thing. Whether I am building stupid apps for no reason or tackling
      the badwidth issues for the entire world.</p>
    <p>After writing software professionally for a number of years I became fascinated with open source this and that
      and something else. </p>

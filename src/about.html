    <p>My current day job is working for Microsoft in the Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) where I have really been
      getting into the depths of the open source world in ways I never knew were possible. I've always been fascinated
      with open source and the intersection between community and engineering, so when I saw an opportunity to join this
      fantastic team I jumped on it. We run the open source program at Microsoft with an engineering mindset, pushing
      for culture change, breaking down barriers, and building a lot of really cool stuff.

    <p>I've been working professionally as a software developer for about 10 years, but before I fell in love with
      coding I got a degree from Penn State in Electrical Engineering. As amazing as it is to build things in the
      physical world with electronics and signals, there is nothing quite like the limitless possibilities of building
      with code.</p>
    <p>I'm almost always making something and I have had more failed ideas than I can keep track of, but plenty of
      successes too! If you want to know more about what I'm up to right now, please feel free to reach out.</p>

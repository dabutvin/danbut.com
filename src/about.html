    <p>I’ve been writing software since I don’t know and something else. I currently work for Microsoft in the Open
      Source Programs Office (OSPO) where I have really been getting into the depths of the open source world in ways I
      never something.
    </p>
    <p>After writing software professionally for a number of years I became fascinated with open source this and that
      and something else. </p>
    <p>One thing led to another and this or that happened and then I ended up in this situation or that situation and
      all of a sudden here I am and there I was. I just knew it and I knew it well. From that point on I was hooked. I
      am a developer and a developer I am. This is my thing. Whether I am building stupid apps for no reason or tackling
      the badwidth issues for the entire world.</p>
